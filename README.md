# hello-world
very first github experience

Hello everyone!

My name is Arya, and I am currently learning about coding!
It is such an amazing experience to know how coding works
Even I still don't understand the frameworks like HTML, CSS, Ruby, Java but I feel challanged to learn more
Soon, I will able to create a simple coding thing, like developing a website or something

Every journey has it first step, so embrace yourself!
